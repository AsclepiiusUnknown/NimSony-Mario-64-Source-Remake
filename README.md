# Mario 64 Source Remake
## Remake of an amazing Mario 64 Remake by NimSony

This project is an attempt to decompile the last publicly available version of NimSony's brilliant attempt at remaking Super Mario 64 in Unity which was then taken down due to too many similarities between the remake and original. If successful, the sourcecode will then be configured into a not copyrighted game and both the updates (.exe) and the sourcecode (for Unity Editor) will be accessible on this GitHub page. This will be heavily modified from both Nintendo and NimSony's original projects in order to avoid conflicts regarding the Intellectual Property (IP).
