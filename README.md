# NimSony Mario 64 Source Remake
 Remake of an amazing Mario 64 Remake by NimSony

An attempt to decompile the last version of NimSony's brilliant attempt at remaking Super Mario 64 in unity. If successful, the sourcecode will then be configured into a not copyrighted game and both the updates (.exe) and the sourcecode (for Unity Editor) will be accessible. This will be heavily modified from both Nintendo and NimSony's original projects in order to avoid conflicts regarding the Iintellectual Property.
